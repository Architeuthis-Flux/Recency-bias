# Recency Bias


This is a VSCode plugin that colors your code based on when it was written. 

It goes through your git blame history and makes a gradient based on how far down it is, so you can quickly see what was written recently and what was from a while ago.

This is just a vibe coded thing I wanted while I was working on something else, it's not meant to be on all the time, it puts a little button to toggle it from New -> Old -> Off so you can quickly check the relative time your code was committed.
